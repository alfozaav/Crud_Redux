# CRUD with REDUX!

Hi! This is a CRUD application I made using REACT-REDUX, you can modify it, copy it or  clone it in order to improve your skills and the application as well.

### How to use the APP?

When you clone the Repo in your local machine you will need to start **npm** and **react-server**, to to that you need to:
* Open project folder on your terminal.
* Start NPM with **npm start.**
* Start the fake API with **react-server db.json --port 4000**
* Open the DB in your browser by **localhost:4000/productos**
* **Start editing the app**

#### ThatÂ´s all you need to start modifying the app, enjoy it and let you imagination fly!
